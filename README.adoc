= Solar Power Systems

A Modelica-library that enables the design and investigation of solar power systems, focusing on the DC power generated by arbitrarily oriented PV modules based on the irradiance in the horizontal plane; air temperature; and wind speed at the site.

WARNING: this is a pre-release version of the library that is not yet intended for public use -- but we're almost there. See the roadmap below for what we're still working on.
