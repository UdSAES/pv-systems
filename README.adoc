= Solar Power Systems

A Modelica-library that enables the design and investigation of immobile PV systems, focusing on the power generated by arbitrarily oriented PV modules based on the irradiance in the horizontal plane; air temperature; and wind speed at the site.

The library contains models for three main aspects:

. the calculation of the sun's position with respect to the system's location;
. the estimation of the plane of array (POA) irradiance from direct and diffuse irradiance in the horizontal plane; and
. the calculation of the power generated by the PV modules as a function of POA irradiance, ambient temperature and wind speed.

== Usage
*Getting Started*

* Download the latest stable version of the library from the https://github.com/UdSAES/pv-systems/releases[releases-page on GitHub] or clone the repository locally.
* Ensure that all link:.#dependencies[dependencies] are resolved.
* Open the library in your Modelica-IDE of choice (note that the library was developed using Dymola 2021 and has not been tested with other tools).
* Open `SolarPowerSystems.Examples.PVSystem`; simulate it; and plot a selection of relevant quantities by running the provided plot script (choose `Commands > plotResult` in the Simuation-tab in Dymola).

*Adding New Instances*

* Depending on the input data available, instantiate one of `Irradiance2Power`, `IrradianceTemperature2Power` or `IrradianceTemperatureWindSpeed2Power` in the subpackage `Components`.
* Create new records that inherit from the partial records in `SolarPowerSystems.Records.Base.*` to store the parameter values of the system under investigation.
* Select the newly created records via drop-down in the Parameters-dialog.
* Select the model to be used from the drop-down menu in the "`Model Selection`"-group of the Parameters-dialog.

Currently, there are four choices: two that expect direct and diffuse in the horizontal plane and include models to convert the irradiance to the POA (isotropic/anisotropic); and two that do not alter the supplied irradiance. Three models use a varying efficiency factor to calculate the power as the product of efficiency, POA irradiance and area; one uses the one diode equivalent-circuit model provided in the `PhotoVoltaics`-library.
* Load your input data and connect it to the model instance.
* Simulate ðŸ˜Ž

== Project Status/Roadmap
The library is versioned using https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0] (semver) and follows the semver specification.

The semver specification is about the _public interface_ of a software package; here, the partial models in `SolarPowerSystems/Interfaces/` are seen as the public interface of this library.

** [x] Ensure that all model names and docstrings are descriptive and consistent
** [x] Draw helpful icons
** [ ] Add examples and plot scripts for the most important models
* [ ] Ensure that there is a concise, but helpful README
** [ ] Indicate scope, dependencies and license information
** [ ] Add required logos/funding information

=== v1.0.0
Estimated realization in the first quarter of 2021
